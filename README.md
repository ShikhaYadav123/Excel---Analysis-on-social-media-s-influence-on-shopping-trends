# Excel-Analysis-on-social-media-s-influence-on-shopping-trends
I have created an interactive dashboard to analyse social media' influence on shopping habits. I got the dataset from website - data.world (https://data.world/ahalps/social-influence-on-shopping).
The dataset was quite clean and not much of cleaning was needed. Only quantitative data(no of voters) was available. I have used few formulas like Averageif, nestedif, sumif and xlookup and several charts to create dashboard for analysis purpose.

Insights inferred:
1. Social Media did not have much influence on the people' buying habits. 
2. Of those who have been influenced Instagram has got the highest votes, followed by Facebook.
3. Female' shopping habits were do influenced more compared to the Male.
